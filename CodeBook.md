The final tidy data output includes the following  variables:

1) subject: number 1-30 identifying the person performing the experiment

2) activity: one of 6 physical activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying). These are defined in the 'activity_labels.txt' file provided.

3) averages of the following metrics (list does not include XYZ axes, which may be indicated on the column names to identify the axis of the measurement):

tBodyAcc-mean()
